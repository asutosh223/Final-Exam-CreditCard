## UCLA Extension Data Science Certificate

Final Exam

### Proposal
Prepare a proposal in which you describe work to be done in analysis of the following
dataset: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

### Domain Background

In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain
from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project
should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can
or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in
this section, including why that research is relevant.

### Problem Statement

In this section, you will want to clearly define the problem that you are trying to
solve, including the strategy (outline of tasks) you will use to achieve the desired
solution. You should also thoroughly discuss what the intended solution will be
for this problem. 

Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:

  • Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what
you are expecting to solve?

  • Have you thoroughly discussed how you will attempt to solve the problem?
  
  • Is an anticipated solution clearly defined? Will the reader understand what
results you are looking for?


### Metrics
In this section, you will need to clearly define the metrics or calculations you
will use to measure performance of a model or result in your project. These
calculations and metrics should be justified based on the characteristics of the
problem and problem domain. 

Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:

  • Are the metrics you’ve chosen to measure the performance of your models
clearly discussed and defined?

  • Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on
the problem and solution?


### Data Exploration
In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the
problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input
data (or input files), or even an environment. Any abnormalities or interesting
qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified
(such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers).

Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:

• Have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a
data sample been provided to the reader?

• Are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant
results from this calculation been discussed?

• Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or
dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values,
outliers, etc.)

### Exploratory Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes
or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The
visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this
visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. 

Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:

• Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset
or input data?

• Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?

• If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?


### Solution Statement
In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be
applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s)
given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that
the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or
logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and
clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs
more than once).

### Algorithms and Techniques
In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend
to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. 

Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:

• Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters
in the project clearly defined?

  • Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?

• Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the
algorithms and techniques chosen?

### Benchmark
In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or
threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The
reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established
result) should be discussed. NOTE: This model should be fit and is the
only model fitting to be done for the proposal. 

Questions to ask yourself
when writing this section:

• Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for
measuring performance?

• Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by
hypothesis)?

### Project Design
In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution
given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may
consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being
used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The
workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the
previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations,
pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is
not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of
the capstone project.
